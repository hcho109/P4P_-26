        <h3>Instructions for annotating Emotion in Speech</h3>

            <h4><i>Using Discrete/Categorical Emotion Model</i></h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Play the video and carefully observe the content, paying attention to the emotions expressed by the speaker or characters.</li>
                <li>Based on the emotions conveyed in the video/audio, choose the most suitable emotion label from the provided options. Examples of emotion labels may include happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, or others.</li>
                <li>In the text box below, briefly write a specific emotion that you believe best describes the overall emotion delivered in the video/audio.</li>
                <li>Once you have selected the emotion label and written the emotion description, click the "Save as CSV" button to store your annotation. Your input will contribute to the collection and analysis of emotional data in the video/audio.</li>
            </ol><br>
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: Be as accurate as possible in your annotations, capturing the predominant emotion conveyed. If you are unsure or if multiple emotions are present, focus on the primary or most salient emotion you perceive.</p>

            <h4><i>Using One-dimensional (1-D) Emotion Model</i></h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Start playing the video or audio file.</li>
                <li>As you watch a video or listen to audio, pay close attention to the emotional qualities expressed by the speaker.</li>
                <li>Interact with one slider at a time, adjusting it to the most appropriate position based on your understanding of the specific emotional dimension.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Valence slider</strong>: Adjust the "Valence" slider to reflect the pleasantness or unpleasantness of the emotion conveyed. Move it left for negative valence and right for positive valence based on your interpretation of the emotional content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Arousal slider</strong>: Adjust the "Arousal" slider to capture the intensity or level of activation of the emotion conveyed. Move it left for low arousal and right for high arousal based on your perception of emotional intensity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dominance slider</strong>: Adjust the "Dominance" slider to indicate the level of control or power associated with the emotion conveyed. Move it left for low dominance (independent) and right for high dominance (dependent) as you perceive shifts in the speaker's perceived control.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Once you have finished watching the video or listening to the audio, the data will be recorded automatically. </li>
                <li>You can proceed to save the current annotated data if you are satisfied with the current values.</li>
                <li>Repeat steps 3-5 for each emotional dimension, adjusting one slider at a time based on your perception.</li>
                <li>Once you have finished annotating the emotions, you can save the annotated data of all three emotion dimensions at once. Click the “Save all current values as CSV” button at the bottom.</li>
            </ol><br>
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: Remember to adjust each slider independently, focusing on one emotional dimension at a time, to accurately capture the perceived intensity, valence, and dominance of the emotions expressed throughout the content.</p>

            <h4><i>Using Two-dimensional (2-D) Emotion Model</i></h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Familiarize yourself with the valence-arousal plot: Take a moment to understand the valence and arousal dimensions represented on the plot. Valence refers to the positivity or negativity of an emotion, while arousal indicates the intensity or level of activation.</li>    </li>
                <li>Start the video or audio and listen carefully to the speech. Pay attention to the emotions conveyed by the speaker or characters.</li>
                <li>As the video or audio plays, move your mouse cursor on the valence-arousal plot based on your perception of the emotions expressed. Position the cursor vertically to indicate the valence (positive at the top, negative at the bottom) and horizontally to represent the arousal (high arousal on the right, low arousal on the left).</li>
                <li>Continuously adjust your cursor position on the plot to match your evolving perception of the emotions throughout the video or audio. This allows you to capture any shifts or changes in valence and arousal levels.</li>
                <li>After the video or audio ends, if you are satisfied with your annotation, click the "Save as CSV" button to record your valence-arousal annotation.</li>
            </ol><br>
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: Be as accurate as possible in your annotations, capturing the predominant emotion conveyed. If you are unsure or if multiple emotions are present, focus on the primary or most salient emotion you perceive.</p>
