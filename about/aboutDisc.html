            <li>Play the video and carefully observe the content, paying attention to the emotions expressed by the speaker or characters.</li>
            <li>Based on the emotions conveyed in the video/audio, choose the most suitable emotion label from the provided options. Examples of emotion labels may include happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, or others.</li>
            <li>In the text box below, briefly write a specific emotion that you believe best describes the overall emotion delivered in the video/audio.</li>
            <li>Once you have selected the emotion label and written the emotion description, click the "Save as CSV" button to store your annotation. Your input will contribute to the collection and analysis of emotional data in the video/audio.</li>
        </ol><br>
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: Be as accurate as possible in your annotations, capturing the predominant emotion conveyed. If you are unsure or if multiple emotions are present, focus on the primary or most salient emotion you perceive.</p>
