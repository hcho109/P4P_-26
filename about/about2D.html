        <h4><i>Using Two-dimensional (2-D) Emotion Model</i></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Familiarize yourself with the valence-arousal plot: Take a moment to understand the valence and arousal dimensions represented on the plot. Valence refers to the positivity or negativity of an emotion, while arousal indicates the intensity or level of activation.</li>    </li>
            <li>Start the video or audio and listen carefully to the speech. Pay attention to the emotions conveyed by the speaker or characters.</li>
            <li>As the video or audio plays, move your mouse cursor on the valence-arousal plot based on your perception of the emotions expressed. Position the cursor vertically to indicate the valence (positive at the top, negative at the bottom) and horizontally to represent the arousal (high arousal on the right, low arousal on the left).</li>
            <li>Continuously adjust your cursor position on the plot to match your evolving perception of the emotions throughout the video or audio. This allows you to capture any shifts or changes in valence and arousal levels.</li>
            <li>After the video or audio ends, if you are satisfied with your annotation, click the "Save as CSV" button to record your valence-arousal annotation.</li>
        </ol><br>
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: Be as accurate as possible in your annotations, capturing the predominant emotion conveyed. If you are unsure or if multiple emotions are present, focus on the primary or most salient emotion you perceive.</p>
